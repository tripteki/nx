# Polyrepo/Monorepo Management Documentation

## 1. Monorepo Flavor

Monorepos can be organized in various ways depending on the project requirements. Here are three common types:

### Standalone-Based Monorepo

- **Description**: Projects are isolated from each other but reside within the same repository. Each project manages its own dependencies and configurations.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for projects that need clear separation but benefit from shared tooling and versioning.

### Package-Based Monorepo

- **Description**: The repository is organized into multiple packages, each with its own `package.json` or configuration file. These packages are often interdependent.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for projects where packages share common dependencies and code, such as libraries and tools used together.

### Integrated Monorepo-Based

- **Description**: All projects and their dependencies are tightly integrated, often with a single set of configurations and shared code.
- **Use Case**: Best for projects that need a high level of interdependency and cohesive version management.

For more information on different flavors of monorepos, you can refer to this [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@harshverma04111989/different-flavors-of-monorepos-521df49131d0).

**Visualizes the relationships between Projects**: 
  ```sh
  #!/bin/sh
  npx nx graph
  ```

## 2. Buildable and Publishable Project

In a monorepo setup, projects can be configured to be buildable and publishable. This involves setting up build and deployment processes, managing dependencies, and ensuring compatibility.

### Key Concepts

- **Buildable Projects**: Projects that can be compiled or transpiled into deployable artifacts.
- **Publishable Projects**: Projects that can be released or distributed, often including steps for publishing to package registries or artifact repositories.

For details on setting up project dependency rules and configurations, see [Nx Project Dependency Rules](https://nx.dev/concepts/decisions/project-dependency-rules).

## 3. Pipeline Task

Pipeline management in a monorepo involves running tasks efficiently and handling dependencies between tasks. Nx provides tools to streamline this process.

### Key Commands

- **Run a Specific Task**: 
  ```sh
  #!/bin/sh
  npx nx run <task> <project>
  ```

Example: `npx nx run build my-project`

- **Run Multiple Tasks**: 
  ```sh
  #!/bin/sh
  npx nx run-many -t <tasks>
  ```

Example: `npx nx run-many -t build lint test e2e cache`

- **Run Affected Tasks**: 
  ```sh
  #!/bin/sh
  npx nx affected -t <tasks>
  ```

Example: `npx nx affected -t build lint test e2e cache`
